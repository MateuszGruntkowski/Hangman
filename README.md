This Java program implements the classic game of Hangman. In Hangman, the player tries to guess a word by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses. If the player guesses the word correctly within the allotted number of guesses, they win; otherwise, they lose.

Features
1. Word Selection: The game selects a random word from a list of words stored in a text file.
2. User Input: The player inputs letters to guess the word. The game checks if the guessed letters are present in the word.
3. Hangman Visual: The game displays a visual representation of the hangman as the player makes incorrect guesses.
4. Win/Lose Conditions: The game ends when the player correctly guesses the word or when the hangman is fully drawn (indicating the player has run out of guesses).
